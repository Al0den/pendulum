# An attempt at balancing a n pendulum using NEAT

This code isn't really meant to be run on other devices, and more as an educational tool.

If you want to run it locally on your machine, you should first execute `make`, which will build the dependencies and compile the files.

Then, you can either run `make test`, `make train`, `make debug` depending on use cases.
